# Set up Tensorflow
> (TensorFlow™)[https://www.tensorflow.org/] is an open source software library for high performance numerical computation. Its flexible architecture allows easy deployment of computation across a variety of platforms (CPUs, GPUs, TPUs), and from desktops to clusters of servers to mobile and edge devices. Originally developed by researchers and engineers from the Google Brain team within Google’s AI organization, it comes with strong support for machine learning and deep learning and the flexible numerical computation core is used across many other scientific domains.
Most of the projects included in this Git will use Tensorflow with Keras as a tool to create and implement various Deep Neural Networks.
In this project, I will guide you how to set up the environment for Python on Windows.
