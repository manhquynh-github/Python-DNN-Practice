# Python-DNN-Practice
This Git contains multiple simple projects (of my own) to practice building a Deep Neural Network from scratch.

## Projects
1. [/PythonDNNPractice](/PythonDNNPractice) — Build a DNN from scratch with no framework or library
2. [/PythonSetUpTensorflow](/PythonSetUpTensorflow) — Set up Tensorflow for Python
3. [/PythonKerasPractice](/PythonKerasPractice) — Build a DNN using Tensorflow+Keras
